// working wth github workflow

> workflow is writen in YAML file, which follows python like structure.( * indentation)

# Example 1
```yml
name: hello_action # name of Action / which we sow in "github action" tab
run-name: runner_name üöÄ # name of instance
on: [push] # event which devine when to triger this workflow
jobs:   # defines what to do when get trigered (can contain multiple jobs)
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:  # job 1 ( jobs should have same indentation) ; performed on github server
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Os will be required to run tasks (github server; vm instance)
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code 
              # 'uses' tells the workflow to use the action located at the actions/checkout@v3 repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # lode file to server ; than we can perform various task there
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |                               # what is this ‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ùì
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
  
  job-2: 
    build:
      ...
```
## we can access specific information from github using github object
## we can access specific information from server instance(runner) through runner object
```yml
owner name: ${{ github.actor }}
os: ${{ runner.os }}
```

## we can access output from steps
```yml
  run: echo "${{ steps.package.outputs.content }}"
```

# Example 2 | strategy use case
```yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Matrix builds: Test code against multiple versions of a language, operating systems, or other configurations.
    # Parallelizing independent tasks: Distribute independent tasks across multiple runners for faster execution.
    # Branching workflows: Conditionally determine job execution based on environment variables or context.
    strategy:
      matrix: 
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9]
# The strategy.matrix section creates two separate runs of this job, one for each Python version listed in the python-version array (3.8 and 3.9).
```

- The strategy section is **optional** and not required for every workflow file.
- It offers flexibility in controlling job execution and creating diverse testing scenarios.

# Example 3 | covering all context
```yml

name: Context Demo Workflow

on: [push]  # Trigger on push events

env:
  GLOBAL_ENV_VAR: "This is a global environment variable"

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9]

    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set job-level variable
        env:
          JOB_ENV_VAR: "This is a job-level environment variable"
        run: |
          echo "Workflow name: ${{ github.workflow }}"
          echo "Branch name: ${{ github.ref }}"
          echo "Global environment variable: ${{ env.GLOBAL_ENV_VAR }}"
          echo "Job environment variable: ${{ env.JOB_ENV_VAR }}"
          echo "Python version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}"

      - name: Install Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest tests

  deploy:
    needs: build  # Dependency on the build job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && steps.build.outcome == 'success'  # Conditional execution

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: echo "Deploying to production..."
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_API_KEY }}  # Accessing a secret
